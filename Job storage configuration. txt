Ververica Platform maintains a record of deployment jobs in persistent storage, as well as in AppManager memory. 
You can view the information regarding all the terminal jobs for a specific deployment.  Terminal jobs refer to jobs that have any of these VVP specific statuses: FAILED, TERMINATED, and FINISHED.
By default, VVP stores an unlimited number of terminal jobs. However, you can configure the deletion of terminal jobs based on specific criteria such as time interval or the maximum number of jobs to be kept in history. This configuration can be done optionally during the installation of VVP


Configuration
During VVP installation you can configure the following  two optional properties:
vvp.job-service.max-number-jobs-in-terminal-state - defines the maximum number of terminal jobs per deployment that should be always kept in jobs history. 
vvp.job-service.jobs-cleanup-interval - defines the duration of cleanup interval. The format of the interval follows Springâ€™s Duration conversion.


Note: to change these parameters VVP must be stopped, and then started with new configuration.
